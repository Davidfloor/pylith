# Step 3: Shear Displacement and Tractions

In Step 3 we replace the Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions on the +y and -y boundaries with equivalent Neumann (traction) boundary conditions.
In order to maintain symmetry and prevent rigid body motion, we constrain both the x and y displacements on the +x and -x boundaries.
The solution matches that in Step 2.
{numref}`fig:example:box:2d:step03:diagram` shows the boundary conditions on the domain.

Boundary conditions for shear deformation.
We constrain the x and y displacements on the +x and -x boundaries.
We apply tangential (shear) tractions on the +y and -y boundaries.

## Simulation parameters

The parameters specific to this example are in `step03_sheardisptract.cfg`.

The primary change from Step 2 is the use of Neumann (traction) boundary conditions in `pylith.problem.bc`.
The tractions are uniform on each of the two boundaries, so we use a `UniformDB`.
In PyLith the direction of the tangential tractions in 2D is defined by the cross product of the +z direction and the outward normal on the boundary.
On the +y boundary a positive tangential traction is in the -x direction, and on the -y boundary a positive tangential traction is in the +x direction.
We want tractions in the opposite direction as shown by the arrows in {numref}`fig:example:box:2d:step03:diagram`, so we apply negative tangential tractions.

As expected, the output written to the terminal is nearly identical to what we saw for Steps 1 and 2.

## Visualizing the results

In {numref}`fig:example:box:2d:step03:solution` we use ParaView to visualize the x displacement field using the `viz/plot_dispwarp.py` Python script.
As in Step 2 we override the default name of the simulation file with the name of the current simulation before running the `viz/plot_dispwarp.py` Python script.

Solution for Step 3.
The colors of the shaded surface indicate the magnitude of the x displacement, and the deformation is exaggerated by a factor of 1000.
The undeformed configuration is show by the gray wireframe.
The solution matches the one from Step 2.
